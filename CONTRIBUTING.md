# Contributing

As an open source project, this module is open for anyone to use, fork, modify, or contribute back to.

If you encounter a bug, you can either
[leave an issue](https://github.com/signify-nz/composer-security-checker/issues), or you could
try your hand at fixing it via [a pull request](https://github.com/signify-nz/composer-security-checker/pulls).

Any feature requests or recommendations should be raised as [an issue](https://github.com/signify-nz/composer-security-checker/issues).

This package adheres to PSR12 coding standards.

Commit messages should be [semantic](https://seesparkbox.com/foundry/semantic_commit_messages), though the style used for this module differs from that reference in the following ways:
- The first letter after the commit type is capitalised.
- A fullstop is placed at the end of the commit message.
